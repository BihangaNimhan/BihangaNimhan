# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Website and Software development.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on AI based fevelopments.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with improve my coding skills.<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning React.<br>üí¨ Ask me about PHP development.<br>‚ö° Fun fact  "Did you know that the term 'bug' to describe a computer program error dates back to 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer? She removed the moth and taped it into the computer's logbook, coining the term 'debugging' in the process. So, every time I code, I'm helping keep those bugs at bay!"
